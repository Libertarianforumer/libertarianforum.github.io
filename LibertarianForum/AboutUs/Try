                    <h1 class = "sectiontitle">THE FORUM</h1>
                    <p class = "durdombo">The L-Forum has been founded soon after the impressive victory of Javier Milei in the struggle for Argentinian presidency on November 19, 2023. Having become the first libertarian head of country in the history of humanity, he inspired like-minded people all over the world: supporters of uncompromisable freedom have finally asserted themselves on  the international stage. With all eyes directed at free-spirited Argentina, radically contrasting with the increasingly unfree rest of the world, it seems to be the right time for libertarianism to regain attention, as it obviously got a new start.<br> </p>  

                    <p class = "durdombo">With this idea in mind, students from Maastricht University have established an association with its own information platform. The purpose is to restudy the theory behind libertarian worldview, gather international experience, come up with different proposals, concentrate all the knowledge and practice, and eventually provide a clearly formulated alternative vision of society, economy and politics, which would be a proper response to the threat posed by descending darkness of statism and serfdom to democracy and liberty.</p>

                <article class = "fielder">
                    <h1 class = "sectiontitle">BASICS OF PHILOSOPHY</h1>
                    <p class = "durdombo"> The key word of libertarianism is <strong>freedom</strong>. Absolute and uncompromisable. Freedom of speech, freedom of choice, freedom of individual. </p>

                        <p class = "durdombo"> The other two pillars of this philosophy are <strong>private property</strong> and <strong>non-aggression principle </strong> (<strong>NAP</strong>), meaning that you are free to do anything you want to with your property, except aggression, that is attacking or cheating on other people. This is the only limit imposed on one’s freedom. For the rest – you are free as a bird in the sky. </p>

                        <p class = "durdombo"> Libertarians believe that the way to freedom is based on: (1) the rule of law, which should be  formulated clearly and unambiguously, and (2) your control of property belonging to you. </p>

                        <p class = "durdombo"> The former (1) guarantees you the legal freedom, prohibiting other people from imposing their will on you, ensuring the equality of opportunity, particularly, opportunity to earn and spend. </p>

                        <p class = "durdombo"> The latter (2) gives you the factual freedom: if you are in charge of your money, you are free to spend it the way you want: go on a travel, buy a car or a house, in other words – you are free in a choice. </p>

                        <p class = "durdombo"> From this perspective, the State is a primary threat to all the three values: after all, the State has a monopoly on violence. The latter gives the government, composed of ambitious and greedy politicians, a right to attack people, impose rules and laws which take away the individual’s liberty and private property. In this quality, the State has historically proved itself to be oppressive. In fact, it uses every opportunity to limit you in your freedom by justifying such measures with the "common good", consistently downplaying the role and will of the individual and presenting itself as the only powerful player, able to achieve the "high purpose". </p>

                        <p class = "durdombo"> However, Libertarians believe the opposite. Unlike statists, they trust people and their ability to make the right choice. Every person is unique, and when unbounded, is able to tackle any challenge much better than a bunch of bureaucrats. He can even build rockets and send them into space.  An individual, who proudly shrugged like Ayn Rand's Atlas, is able to raise the whole world on his shoulders and save humanity from the coming floods. </p>

                        <p class = "durdombo"> This faith is leading libertarians to the simple socio-economic equation: <strong>individual + freedom = happiness</strong>, which characterises all their factions, ranging from minarchists and objectivists to anarcho-capitalists and voluntaryists. And thus, it is the basis of the philosophy that the L-Forum aims to promote on this platform. </p>

                    <p>I am a second-year Economics student, the founder of the Libertarian Forum and creator of this website. Being a deeply convinced anarcho-capitalist, I stand for free speech, free market, free enterprise, to put it shortly, for FREEDOM everywhere and in everything. The world is facing many problems these days, the most serious one being not the climate change or immigration but a severe lack of freedom, shrinking infinitely everyday. There is no time to lose: advancing statism should be defeated by advancing liberty. So be it!</p>
