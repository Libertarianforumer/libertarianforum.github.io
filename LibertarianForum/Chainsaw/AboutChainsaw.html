                     <p class = "paragraph"> Having chosen the social(ist) way of development, many countries have been following the path of extensive statism, inefficient intervention into economy, increasing taxes, extremely questionable government spending, and dozens of prohibitive laws. This led the world away from the bright prospects of an economically fast growing free-spiritted democracy into the maw of a bureaucratic Leviathan, which is progressively transforming into a Matrix-like system of ubiquitous digital control. To get our civilization back on the track, a radical 180 degrees-turn is needed. </p>  
                    
                     <p class = "paragraph">In this context, the first libertarian president in history Javier Milei has been waving with a <strong>chainsaw</strong> at his rallies as a symbol of the way he would reform the economy. And given the characteristics of the  system described above,  this is a very good comparison and, indeed, the sole feasible approach to set a vector for positive development. Hence, this part of the L-Forum has been called correspondigly and captures the most recent ideas, opinions and economic proposals by the members. </p>
