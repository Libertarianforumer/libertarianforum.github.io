                         Libertarianism has a long history, being philosophically deep-rooted in the ancient times. However, as a clearly defined ideological worldview, it has emerged on the brink of the XIX and XX centuries based on the classical version of liberalism, the principles of which were put forward by Adam Smith and Alexis de Tocqueville. Originally, liberals were standing for many ideals shared by contemporary libertarians: civil liberties, rule of law, and private property, opposing absolute monarchy, dictatorship, and slavery. However, given that many of its members have at some point raised the banner of statism and adopted the interventionist policies, the liberal camp fell apart, with those loyal to the ideas of individualism and free market forming their own political movement. </p>
                
                    <p class = "paragraph"> 
                         The foundations of libertarianism were laid by such notable philosophers and economists as Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, James M. Buchanan, Ayn Rand, Murray Rothbard, and many others. Whilst socio-political context was largely defined by Buchanan's, Rothbard's and Rand's works, the economic framework is based on two powerful schools of thought, namely Austrian School and Chicago School, to which Hayek and Friedman belonged.  </p>

                         However, the XX century has given rise to many reactionary movements, reactionary in the sense that it was not individual freedom viewed as a fundamental value anymore, but rather community, collectivism, and equality. The idea of a powerful all-mighty state providing these new ideals was widely propagated by communists, socialists, fascists, national socialists, militarists, neomonarchists, and even conservatives on behalf of Christian democrats. Besides, chose not to stand aside but raise a banner of government interventionism. This left many of their former companions lost of their identity. As a result, those loyal to the principles of liberty and democracy responded by leaving the redefined field of liberalism and entered a new movement: libertarianism. </p>
